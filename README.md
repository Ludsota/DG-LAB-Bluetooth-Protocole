# DG-LAB Coyote V3.0 & PawPrints – Local WebBluetooth Toolkit

This repository collects and documents my **independent research** on connecting **DG-LAB Coyote V3.0** and **DG-LAB PawPrints** directly from a **local computer** without relying on the official app or third-party apps (xToys).

The goal is to make it possible to control devices using **Web Bluetooth**, through a browser such as **Chrome**, in a fully standalone setup.

## ✨ What is inside?

- Practical notes about the BLE protocol (services, characteristics, payloads)
- Web-Bluetooth test pages (local, static HTML)
- Minimal JavaScript examples
- Device exploration tools
- Experimental UI controls

Everything runs **locally** in the browser.  
No external servers, no external platform, no uploads, no cloud.

## 🤖 Assisted by AI

Some parts of this research, prototyping and documentation were
written or assisted using large language models, including  
**OpenAI GPT-5.1**, **OpenAI CODEX**, and **Google Gemini 3.0 Pro**.

These tools were used for:
- code generation
- protocol analysis support
- HTML/JS examples
- writing explanations and notes

Human review and validation remains applied on all critical elements, and I personally test everything on my own hardware first — with electrodes safely placed on my arm — before considering any other kind of experimentation.
